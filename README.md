#Some prep that I did for my first year programming course
I just wanted to to some sample code that might pop up on my ECE 150 exam. Implementation needs to be fast and understandable.

##TODO
[]get ith bit of a number   
[]get median of an array   
[]stack   
[x]linkedList   
[x]fibonacci (iterative)   
[x]fibonacci (recursive)
[]fibonacci (dp)   
[]getMaxInt (recursive)   
[]greatest common denominator   

##Topics worth considering
>header files   
>command line arguments   
>function overload   
>classes   
>operator overload
